                            <p>The Affordable Care Act of 2010 has led to an increased focus on the use of measures of healthcare 
                                quality in novel reimbursement models for payment. My research interest is in the development, measurement, 
                                and validation of healthcare quality measures for evaluation of health plans and community pharmacies. 
                                As part of a collaboration with Pharmacy Quality Alliance, I have conducted the testing, risk adjustment, 
                                and evaluation of several quality measures. I also served as a co-chair on a measure development team to 
                                lead a multi-stakeholder national workgroup that developed three quality measures in the area of quality 
                                of opioid prescribing. These three quality measures (Initial Opioid Prescribing: Long Duration, Long Acting, 
                                and High Dose) were later endorsed by the membership of PQA and approved in May of 2019. The objective of my 
                                research efforts in this area is to improve the measurement of healthcare quality in the United States and the 
                                effectiveness of quality improvement programs.

                            <p>Increase in prevalence of long-term opioid prescribing in the United States is associated with significant 
                                increases in rates of morbidity and mortality. I am interested in investigating the safety of opioid prescribing 
                                among individuals with non-cancer pain, with a special focus on older adults. I have served as a co-investigator 
                                on NIDA R15 award investigating prevalence and safety of long-term opioid use among older adults. I have also served 
                                as senior author on projects examining opioid use patterns in response to acute pain episodes in children enrolled 
                                in Medicaid, and evaluating the effect of transient opioid use on incidence of exacerbations among patients in COPD. 
                                We hope that the findings from these studies can aid in the development of guidelines and interventions to improve 
                                safe and responsible use of prescription opioids

                                college-enrolled adults leading to a widespread economic and clinical burden. Our research in this area is focused 
                                on preventing nonmedical use by decreasing misdiagnosis of ADHD and excessive prescribing of stimulant medications. 
                                Our research has developed a scale for detection of malingering of ADHD symptoms, in order to improve diagnostic 
                                validity and reduce overdiagnosis. We have also studied the factors contributing to nonmedical use of prescription 
                                stimulants and piloted strategies to improve validity of self-report of nonmedical use of prescription stimulants.
